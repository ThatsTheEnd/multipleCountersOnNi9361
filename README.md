# multipleCountersOnNi9361
Example code to acquire from multiple counters on the NI cDAQ9361

## Reason
This repo is mostly for me to remember the next time how to do it.

## Origin
Simple task: read multiple counter inputs in either LabVIEW or Python, but I kept getting `Error -50103` no matter what I tried, until I stumbled upon this article and followed up on the next link:
- https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA03q000001DkIgCAK&l=en-CH
- https://forums.ni.com/t5/Example-Code/Encoder-Velocity-Measurements-and-the-NI-9361/ta-p/3504542?profile.language=en
That was a start, so I decided to create a proper example and share with my later self (and you).
If I have the time I will also add the python example.
